# Technical-Debt-Management-ToolBox
In the last years, the technical debt research community has been spending increasingly large effort on the different activities of Technical Debt Management (TDM). To a large extent, this research is focusing on issues related to cost and benefit analysis of software quality management.  

Technical Debt Management ToolBox is a ToolBox developed in context of a European Union project H2020 (SDK4ED - https://sdk4ed.eu). It provides analysis in all aspects of technical debt (TD principal, TD interest, TD breaking point, TD interest probability).

# Definition of Technical Debt (TD)
**Technical debt is a software engineering metaphor, referring to the eventual financial consequences of trade-offs between shrinking product time to market and poorly specifying, or implementing a software product, throughout all development phases.** 
Based on its inter-disciplinary nature, i.e. software engineering and economics, research on managing technical debt should be balanced between software engineering and economic theories. 

It can be an appropriate business decision to take on technical debt, but if such debt is allowed to grow, the lack of quality of the system may eventually make it too expensive to maintain, at which point the business or team may need to declare “technical bankruptcy” and rewrite the application rather than continue to try to maintain it.

As with financial debt, technical debt must be paid back, and is comprised of two parts: **principal and interest**. In the software development metaphor, the interest is paid in the form of additional work required to maintain the software system given its sub-optimal code. Time spent improving the code, which isn’t directly adding customer value and which wouldn’t be necessary if the code were optimally designed currently, represents paying down the principal on the debt. Usually this takes the form of **refactoring the code to improve its design**, making it more appropriate to its current requirements and conditions.
